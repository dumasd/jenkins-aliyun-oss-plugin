<div>You can set the prefix of the object key and support the use of Jenkins environment variables
    such as: "${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/"<br/>
    It can't begin with '/' and must end with '/'<br/>
    Assume the job name is 'foo/bar'. The settings are as follows:<br/>

    1. OSS Config Base Prefix: jenkins/<br/>
    2. Path Prefix: ${JOB_NAME}/${BUILD_NUMBER}/<br/>
    3. Uploading Artifacts: hello.txt,hello1.txt<br/>

    Then the OSS key of 'hello.txt' will be: jenkins/foo/bar/5/hello.txt<br/>
